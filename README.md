In the second task I firstly decided to work with num, base, but then I've tried to push it like a hundred times in githud and I supposed that maybe the reson is my code... 
I know that this assumption is wrong, but I've decided to check if it's the reason. Plush I was writing both script and that's why you can face a different scrinshot in my code.. 
Anyway, sorry for that inconvinience, I've tried my best

And as I hadn't written a conclusion, I will write it there.
I was really glad to become a bit more specialliesed on writing Unix and phyton and currently find a lot of positive impact of that. I could'n say that it was a simple road, but efficient and extremely engaging. 
Thank you a lot!
